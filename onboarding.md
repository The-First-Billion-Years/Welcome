Where `ku username` is e.g. abc123

## DAWN website

- Instructions to set up your profile are [here](https://cosmicdawn.dk/wikidawn/visitors-and-newcomers/creating-a-new-dawn-profile/)

## Printing
- Add the DAWN printer nbb-2h-mfp (instructions [here](https://wiki.nbi.ku.dk/handbook/Printer_Setup)). On a Mac you can add the printer via IP address
- The printer is in the room in on the other side of the coffee area in the tower next to DAWN (marked in red on this map)
