# Onboarding

Here is some useful information to get setup at NBI/DAWN

## Internet

- Join the NBI wifi network (preferred, so that you can print)
- You can also login to _eduroam_ to access wifi in most educational institution worldwide, using your KU login

For both NBI wifi and eduroam your username and password are always:
```
Username: <ku username>@ku.dk
Password: <ku password>
```
Where `ku username` is e.g. abc123

## Printing
- Add the DAWN printer nbb-2h-mfp (instructions [here](https://wiki.nbi.ku.dk/handbook/Printer_Setup)). The printer is in the room in on the other side of the coffee area in the tower next to DAWN.

## Software
- Microsoft Office 365 can be installed for free using your KU login from [here](http://www.office.com/getoffice365), click "Install Office" in top right corner (more instructions [here](https://kunet.ku.dk/employee-guide/ITvejl/Install%20Office%20365.pdf))
- More software info at [NBI IT](https://wiki.nbi.ku.dk/handbook/Category:Software) - I will update as I test any of these, haven't tried yet
