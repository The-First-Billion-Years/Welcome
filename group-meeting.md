# Group Meeting

We meet at 1pm in the DAWN lounge on Mondays according to this [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ScRp66qYRG-TKGsesqvvinewrCigUkRGCvQWeF3J10Q/edit?usp=sharing)

## Format

- ~10 min Rose/Thorn/Bud (2-3 mins each)
    - A short update on your research progress. The aim is to celebrate our successes, no matter how small, help each other get unstuck, and have some accountability for our progress. Please spend a few minutes before the meeting considering what your items are:
        - üåπ¬†**Rose:**¬†something you did last week that you are proud of
        - üò§¬†**Thorn:**¬†something that you are stuck on that you would like advice on to help make progress this week
        - üå±¬†**Bud:**¬†something you are excited about doing this week
- ~15 min weekly [astro-ph review](https://www.notion.so/Astro-ph-review-b39cbc73840b48a88da91463b7648f35)
    - Take it in turns to very briefly present a few interesting recent papers
    - Give a short overview of the paper + main result, maybe one main figure (see guidelines below)
- 5 mins Q&A
    - Ask any question, maybe about a paper you read, maybe about a ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù astronomical topic that you never fully understood and want some clarification on



## Some notes on presenting a paper:

(from Victoria/UC Davis)

1) **Motivate the paper and offer background**

    Never forget that attendees have varying background knowledge. Thus, make sure that everyone is on the same page and motivated as to why a paper is interesting and important! Devote the first few minutes to general background (not specifically tied to the paper): What is the high-level astrophysics question related to this paper? What is the history of that topic, and what progress has been made over the last several years? What impacts does that topic have for the wider (astro)physics community?

2) **Introduce the authors**

    Next, introduce the paper, including the title and the authors. Where are the author located? What resources did they use? Do they have a history of doing good work on this topic? Give us some social context. This is a good way to learn about our broader (astro)physics community.

3) **Get to the main result ASAP**

    When discussing the contents of the paper, get to the main result as soon as possible, so that we can focus on that. At least initially, go light on the nitty-gritty details of the methodology - we can revisit those with questions and discussion once we know what the main result is.

4) **Evaluate the main result**

    As the presenter, tell us: How robust do you think the main result is? What is the weakest component of the analysis? What future directions do you think that this result will lead to?

5) **What is the single most important take-away?**

    End your presentation with a recap of the single most important take-away and why it matters.
